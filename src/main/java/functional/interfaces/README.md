## Functional interface

- A functional interface can have only one abstract method
- behind a lambda there is a functional interface
- if I don't add the @Functional interface, I will not get an error when I would add one more method.


Note: the restriction for a functional interface to have only one abstract method is required for 
the lambda to execute without ambiguity
